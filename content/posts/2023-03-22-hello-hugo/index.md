A new year, a new blog (platform). Who said you needed to start your new-years blog in January?

Seriously though, after using [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) for a few years now, I decided
to switch things up a bit, and transfer the blog to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Not much will have changed for _you_, well, except the theme, which I quite like. For me
this means less resources on my servers, as it's now a statically generated site.

Let's see how this'll go :)
